# Drawing-Based Image Classification Application

**Drawing-Based Image Classification Application** is an interactive machine learning application that allows users to classify hand-drawn shapes into predefined categories. Using a simple graphical user interface (GUI), users can draw shapes and assign them to one of three classes. The application trains a machine learning model based on these user-generated drawings, enabling it to predict the class of new sketches.

The project provides an easy-to-use canvas for drawing, tools for modifying brush size, and options to train, save, load, and switch between different machine learning models for classification. Built with Python, the application uses popular libraries such as `Tkinter` for the GUI, `PIL` for image manipulation, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning.

## Key Features
- **Canvas Drawing**: Draw shapes using the mouse, with adjustable brush sizes.
- **Class-based Labeling**: Classify drawings into three user-defined categories.
- **Model Training**: Collect user-generated drawings to train a machine learning model.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new drawings in real-time.
- **Model Management**: Save, load, and switch between different machine learning models.
- **Project Persistence**: Save and load the entire project, including classes, images, and trained models.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the application.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
- **OpenCV**: For image manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model training.
